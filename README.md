# ðŸ“š React Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of React projects built as part of the [Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Each folder includes a standalone project focused on different aspects of modern React development â€” from state management and routing to APIs, authentication, and UI design.
